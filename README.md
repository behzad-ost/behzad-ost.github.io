# Hi there, I'm Behzad Ousat! üëã

## üéì About Me

I am a **Ph.D. candidate** at Florida International University, working as a **Research Assistant** at the **Systems Security Lab (SecLab)** under the supervision of **Dr. Amin Kharraz**. My research focuses on **web security** aspect of **Automated Web Agents**, applying **data-driven and machine learning techniques** to detect emerging threats at scale. This includes analyzing **LLM-based browser agents** and automated interactions in the age of the agentic web, as well as developing models to distinguish **human behavior from automated agents**.
In addition to my academic research, I bring over **8 years of experience** as a **Site Reliability Engineer and Software Engineer**, Strong background in **Linux** administration, network protocols, and **DevOps**
practices, with proven ability to adapt between software engineering, infrastructure operations, and research.

## üè¢ Professional Experience

### üéì Graduate Research Assistant | Florida International University (2022 - Present)
- Developed LLM-powered Browser Agents to bypass complex web challenges such as reCaptcha with over 90% success rate, demonstrating critical detection requirements in modern agentic web.
- Implemented ML pipelines to classify users from browser interaction data, creating Time Series data collection, feature extraction, and model training using PyTorch, Scikit-Learn, and LLM services.
- Built a text Captcha solving framework with 80% success rate in real-world websites in a single attempt by using Tensorflow Object Detection trained on data from over 1M websites.
- Analyzed ecosystem-wide Vulnerability Trends by unifying GitHub Advisory and Snyk.io reports across 10+ package managers, uncovering CWE patterns, ecosystem differences, and malicious packages.
- Detected zero-day anomalies within encrypted network flows by implementing Open Set Recognition models in TensorFlow, leveraging feature extraction on terabytes of PCAP data.
- Led research projects in collaboration with faculty, students, and external teams, including Microsoft Security, contributing to open-source tools for user behavior analysis and phishing detection.

### üöÄ Platform Technical Team Lead | Tapsi (2017 - 2021)
- Ensured 99% uptime for 60 microservices by maintaining the infrastructure of over 100 Ubuntu servers for compute clusters and databases across Kubernetes, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.
- Led platform team to design and build Node.js and Python gRPC and Socket message passing libraries with integrated Prometheus and healthcheck probes for full observability in Grafana dashboards.
- Accelerated rapid adoption of new technologies such as MinIO, Vault, Kafka, and Spark, researching and deploying production-ready solutions to enhance platform reliability and data processing capabilities.
- Reduced deployment errors and established automated rollouts by implementing CI/CD pipelines to include canary-testing, staging, and production environments, utilizing Bash and Ansible.
